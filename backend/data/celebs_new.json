        "Intro": "Jim has proven himself a major talent beloved to a wide range of audiences after achieving milestones in stand-up, acting and writing. As approachable as he is edgy, Jim is responsible for some of the funniest and most memorable moment in recent television (primetime, cable and late-night circuit and film. As a stand-up comedian, Gaffigans clever, quiet style has earned him an unprecedented number of appearances on both CBS LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN and NBCs LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN. His recent one hour Comedy Central Special, CD and DVD, all entitled Beyond the Pale have catapulted Gaffigan to one of the most popular touring and recorded comedians in the country today. The DVD for Beyond the Pale went Gold within the first six months. After Gaffigans first appearance on DAVID LETTERMAN, the host personally chose him to develop a sitcom for World Wide Pants. Eighteen months later, WELCOME TO NEW YORK debuted on CBS to critical acclaim. He then co-starred with Ellen DeGeneres on her CBS sitcom THE ELLEN SHOW. For two years he had recurring roles both on FOXs THAT 70'S SHOW and NBCs ED. Jim has also had roles on SEX AND THE CITY, THIRD WATCH and each of the LAW & ORDER shows, among others. Jim can be seen this November in MY BOYS, TBS' first original scripted comedy series. On film, Jim has endeared himself to audiences by taking on vivid supporting characters in a number of genres. In the cult hit SUPER TROOPERS, Gaffigan got huge laughs and famously helped add \"meow\" to the lexicon of Vermont state troopers. Jim's quiet dramatic turn in THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL, a meditation on the aftermath of 9/11, took audiences and critics by surprise as he embodied an office worker broken by tragedy who ultimately explodes in rage. Gaffigans other recent film credits include the forthcoming independent films THE LIVING WAKE and STEPHANIE DALEY. He has also been featured in TRUST THE MAN, 13 GOING ON 30, THREE KINGS, FINAL, IGBY GOES DOWN, ENTROPY and THIRTY YEARS TO LIFE. In 2004, he co-starred in TNTs BAD APPLE, with Chris Noth. Gaffigan recently signed on to co-write and lend his voice to 20 new episodes of PALE FORCE, a series of animated shorts that will air regularly on CONAN and on the internet via webisodes starting in October. The series focuses on two pale crime-fighting superheroes that, like Gaffigan and O'Brien, are equipped with fair skin. Many recognize Gaffigan from his numerous award-winning commercial campaigns, which include Sierra Mist, ESPN, Saturn and Rolling Rock. His commercial presence earned him Business Weeks 1999 \"Salesman of the Year\" honour. Gaffigan currently lives in New York with his family.",

He played for Auxerre, Martigues, Marseille, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Nmes and Leeds United before ending his professional footballing career at Manchester United, where he won four Premier League titles in five years and two League and FA Cup Doubles.\n\nCantona is often regarded as having played a key role in the revival of Manchester United as a footballing force and he enjoys iconic status at the club. He wore the number 7 shirt at United, which was previously worn by George Best and Bryan Robson, and subsequently worn by David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. Cantona is affectionately nicknamed by Manchester United fans \"King Eric\", and was voted as Manchester United's greatest ever player by Inside United magazine. Set against his footballing achievements was a poor disciplinary record throughout his career, including a conviction for assault on a fan in 1995.\n\nFollowing his retirement from football, he took up a career in cinema and had a role in the 1998 film Elizabeth, starring Cate Blanchett, and the 2009 film Looking for Eric.\n\nIn 2010, he debuted as a stage actor in Face au paradis, a French play directed by his wife, Rachida Brakni.\n\nOn 19 January 2011, Cantona joined the revived New York Cosmos as Director of Soccer.",

        "Intro": "Sylvester Stallone (born Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone, July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush.\n\nHe subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976-present), for which he also wrote the screenplays. In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice.\n\nIn 1977, he was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. His film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. His use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nUp until 1982, his films were not big box office successes unless they were Rocky sequels, and none received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo. Originally an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell, First Bloods script was significantly altered by Stallone during the films production. He would play the role in a total of five Rambo films (1982-2019). From the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, he would go on to become one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful action films which were however generally panned by critics. These include Cobra, Tango and Cash, Cliffhanger, the better received Demolition Man, and The Specialist.\n\nHe declined in popularity in the early 2000s but rebounded back to prominence in 2006 with a sixth installment in the Rocky series and 2008 with a fourth in the Rambo series. In the 2010s, he launched The Expendables films series (2010-2014), in which he played the lead as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful Escape Plan, and acted in its sequels. In 2015, he returned to the Rocky series with Creed, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed played by Michael B. Jordan, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long-retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role brought him praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed, as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.",

He is sometimes credited as Alex Hyde White. Known as Punch to friends, he grew up in Palm Springs, CA attending PSHS (Class of 1975) and Georgetown University in Washington DC for one year after which he left to pursue the inevitable acting career. In 1978 he signed with Universal Pictures as one of the last \"contract players\" in Hollywood, in a group that included Lindsay Wagner, Andrew Stevens and Sharon Gless. One of the youngest under contract, at age 18, his first TV job was one line \"leave my mother alone\" spoken to star Jack Klugman on the iconic TV series \"Quincy M.E.\" He recurred in several episodes, each time a different character and also made numerous appearances in \"Battlestar:Galactica\" with Lorne Greene and later \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" which also featured his father Wilfrid. The only time both father and son appeared on screen together was on the Merv Griffin show in 1980. Hyde-White was born in London, the son of Ethel M. (ne Korenman), a stage manager who acted under the name Ethel Drew, and the actor Wilfrid Hyde-White. Hyde-White was married to actress Karen Dotrice, daughter of actor Roy Dotrice from 1986 until 1992. Through his production company TMG, named after mentor, Washington attorney Steven Martindale, he produced the 2002 independent romantic drama, Pursuit of Happiness which starred Frank Whaley, Annabeth Gish, Adam Baldwin and featured the great American comedienne Jean Stapleton in a cameo as the advertising agency's owner. Her son John Putch was the director. Putch directed Alex prior in \"Deep Water\" and since in \"Murder:101\" starring another great American comedian Dick Van Dyke for Hallmark. Alex has worked with Steven Spielberg three times, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, as Young Henry Jones, Sr., Catch Me If You Can and The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn, due for release in 2011. Film heroes growing up included actors Steve McQueen, Spencer Tracy, William Holden (whom Alex knew quite well through family friend Stefanie Powers) and Actor/Filmmakers Warren Beatty and Clint Eastwood. Alex has directed TMG's next production, due for release in Winter/Spring 2011, the hybrid docu-drama \"Three Days (www.threedaysofhamlet.com) and is developing the existentialist crime drama \"King of Infinite Space\" with the books author Tyler Dilts, as an independent film. He is represented by Ann Geddes and Richard Lewis at the Geddes Agency and by well-known Hollywood attorney Michael Donaldson. He is married to Shelly Hyde-White and resides in Santa Monica, California. He has two children, Garrick and Jack.

He immigrated to Lyon in France at the age of thirteen with his brother, Edmond. In 1987, he became a model and established a career in Paris. He moved to the U.S. in 1990. One year before obtaining his college degree, he dropped out of school.\n\nIn 1989, he appeared in a music video of Straight Up by Paula Abdul. Hounsou's film debut was in the 1990 Sandra Bernhard film Without You Im Nothing, and he has had television roles on Beverly Hills, 90210 and ER and a guest starring role on Alias, but received a larger role in the science fiction film Stargate. His first on-screen appearance was in the 1990 Janet Jackson video Love Will Never Do (Without You). He also starred in a 2002 Gap commercial directed by Peter Lindbergh, dancing to a rendition of John Lee Hooker's \"Boom Boom\" by Arrested Development's Baba Oje.\n\nHe received wide critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award nomination for his role as Cinqu in the 1997 Steven Spielberg film Amistad. He gained further notice as Juba, in the 2000 film Gladiator. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for In America, in 2004, becoming the fourth African male to be nominated for an Oscar (along with Basil Rathbone, Cecil Kellaway and Omar Sharif).

In 2008 Hounsou and Simmons visited Hounsou's family and while there, the two participated in a traditional commitment ceremony. On May 30, 2009, Simmons gave birth to their son, Kenzo Lee Hounsou, reportedly named because Kenzo means 3 (Kimora's third child).",
